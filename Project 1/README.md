# Real Estate Analysis: Property Size vs. Location

## Project Overview

This project analyzes a dataset of 21,000 properties for sale in Pakistan, sourced from www.zameen.com .The primary goal is to determine whether sale prices are influenced more by property size or location. Through this project, we explore and apply various data analysis techniques using Python, including data cleaning, visualization, and correlation analysis.

## Key Learning Objectives

- **Data Organization**: Learn to structure and organize information using Pythonâ€™s basic data structures such as lists, dictionaries, and data frames.
- **Data Import & Cleaning**: Import datasets from CSV files and clean the data using the pandas library to prepare it for analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Create visualizations like scatter plots and box plots to explore data distribution and trends.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Examine the relationship between property size, location, and sale prices using correlation techniques.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of 21,000 property listings in Pakistan, including details like price, property size, and location (latitude and longitude). The data is publicly available and can be found [here](www.zameen.com).


## Key Findings

- **Property Size**: Initial analysis shows a positive correlation between property size and sale price. Larger properties generally have higher prices.
- **Location**: Certain locations exhibit a strong influence on property prices, sometimes outweighing the effect of size.
- **Correlation**: Through correlation analysis, we quantify the influence of size and location on prices, aiding in data-driven conclusions.

## Conclusion

This project provides insights into the factors influencing property prices in Pakistan, with a focus on comparing the effects of property size and location. The techniques and methods used can be applied to other real estate datasets or further refined for more granular analysis.
