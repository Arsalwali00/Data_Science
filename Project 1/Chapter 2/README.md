#  Chapter 2 - Data Wrangling With Pandas

## Overview

In this chapter, we delve into data wrangling using the pandas library in Python. Data wrangling involves transforming and mapping raw data into a more suitable format for analysis. This chapter covers essential techniques such as data cleaning, merging, reshaping, and aggregating data.

## Key Learning Objectives

- **Data Cleaning**: Learn to identify and handle missing or inconsistent data.
- **Data Transformation**: Perform operations such as filtering, sorting, and modifying data.
- **Merging and Joining**: Combine data from multiple sources or datasets.
- **Data Aggregation**: Summarize data using grouping and aggregation functions.

## How to Use

1. **Step 1**: Start by exploring the datasets located in the `Resources` folder. These datasets contain raw data that needs to be cleaned and prepared for analysis.
   
2. **Step 2**: Use the provided notebooks or scripts to clean the data. Focus on identifying and handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting data inconsistencies.

3. **Step 3**: Once the data is cleaned, save the processed datasets in the `Clean_CSV` folder. This ensures that you have a clean version of the data ready for further analysis.

Ensure that you follow the steps in sequence to effectively clean and organize the data.

## Conclusion

This chapter equips you with essential data wrangling skills using pandas, enabling you to prepare and manipulate data efficiently for analysis.
