# While you've shown that you can wrangle data using lists and dictionaries, 
# it's not as intuitive as working with, say, a spreadsheet. Fortunately, 
# there are lots of libraries for Python that make it an even better tool 
# for tabular data â€” way better than spreadsheet applications like Microsoft Excel 
# or Google Sheets! One of the best known data science libraries is pandas, 
# # which allows you to organize data into DataFrames
