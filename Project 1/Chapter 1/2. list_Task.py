# Task 1.1.1: One metric that people in the real estate industry look at is price per 
# square meter because it allows them to compare houses of different sizes. Can you 
# use the information in this list to calculate the price per square meter for house_0?

# Declare variable `house_0_list`
house_0_list = [115910.26, 128, 4]

# Declare variable `house_0_price_m2`
house_0_price_m2 = house_0_list[0]/house_0_list[1]

# Print object type of `house_0_price_m2`
print("house_0_price_m2 type:", type(house_0_price_m2))

# Get output of `house_0_price_m2`
print(house_0_price_m2)
